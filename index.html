      <h1>Voder Speech Synthesizer (1939)</h1>

      <p> The Voder was an early attempt at speech synthesis developed by Bell
      Telephone Laboratory for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Controlled by
      hand, the operator manually forms each syllable using complex button
      sequences, and it would take about a year of practice to able to produce
      fluid speech. This website allows you to put yourself in the shoes of the
      few women capable of operating the Voder. </p>

      <p>Try create vowel formants using the button combinations below:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>D+V+J: [AH] as in "father"</li>
        <li>A+K: [EE] as in "heed"</li>
        <li>A+D: [OO] as in "pool"</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p> You can also use the spacebar to create unvoiced noise. For example,
      try pressing the spacebar and immediately hit the key sequence for [EE].
      This will emulate the word "see". </p>
